# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. The dataset contains customer information, service details, and the outcome of whether the customer has churned. This project utilizes machine learning techniques for data exploration, modeling, and feature importance analysis.

## Contents

- **ML\_Engineer\_Churn\_Prediction\_Final.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, from data loading to model evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription-based companies, and predicting it helps prevent customer losses by taking proactive actions. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict churn using a variety of features, including customer demographics, service usage, and payment behavior.

The project follows these major steps:

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Load the dataset and understand its structure, size, and any missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary columns, handle missing values, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform categorical variables into numerical ones, and engineer features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize key relationships in the data to gain insights into customer behavior and identify patterns related to churn.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train several machine learning models to predict churn, including Random Forests and XGBoost. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyze which features are the most impactful in predicting churn, providing business insights for targeted interventions.
7. **Saving and Deploying the Model**: Save the best-performing model for future use and deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Telco customer churn dataset, containing 7,043 entries with 33 features, including:

- **Customer demographics** (e.g., gender, senior citizen status)
- **Service usage** (e.g., internet service type, tenure)
- **Payment information** (e.g., payment method, monthly charges)

The target variable is `Churn Value`, indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `joblib`

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost joblib
```

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```sh
   cd churn-prediction
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook ML_Engineer_Churn_Prediction_Final.ipynb
   ```

   Run all cells in the notebook to see the full analysis and model training.

## Results

- **Model Performance**: The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%, with an F1-score of 0.85 for the churn class. The model effectively identifies customers who are likely to churn, allowing for targeted retention efforts.
- **Key Features**: The most important features influencing churn prediction include `Monthly Charges`, `Contract Type`, and `Tenure`. Customers with month-to-month contracts and higher charges are more likely to churn, while those with longer tenures are less likely to do so.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to predict customer churn, providing valuable insights for reducing customer attrition in a telecommunications company. The analysis highlights actionable factors, such as contract type and monthly charges, that contribute significantly to customer churn.
